Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: A block of code that will be executed IF specific conditions are meet.

Your answer: The driver: The drivers role is to have their hands on the kids typing, all awhile thinking out loud
how we can go about the problem. The navagators job is to deliver clarity to the drive on the course of action. Pair Programming requires two seperate brains travling down the same road to get to a spacific destination. Togeather! 
Researched answer: Paired programming is when two devlopers work togeather to devlope complex systems. The driver writes code and the navagator observe the driver and looks for errors in code and decides the drive can get us to the correct destination when executing code. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A higher order Function uses built in methods to take in a functions argument. an example would be .map,.filter and .function. when we use these built in methods we can
